```javascript
function solution(bridgeLength, weight, truckWeights) {
  let [time, totalWeightOnBridge] = [0, 0];
  let bridge = Array(bridgeLength).fill(0);
  while (truckWeights.length > 0 || totalWeightOnBridge > 0) {
    time++;
    totalWeightOnBridge -= bridge.shift();
    if (
      truckWeights.length > 0 &&
      totalWeightOnBridge + truckWeights[0] <= weight
    ) {
      let nextTruck = truckWeights.shift();
      bridge.push(nextTruck);
      totalWeightOnBridge += nextTruck;
      continue;
    }
    bridge.push(0);
  }
  return time;
